# PixelMap Routing Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The PixelMap application had a routing issue that prevented proper API access in Vercel deployments. The problem was in the `server.js` file where the routing configuration was different for local development and Vercel deployment.

## Root Cause
1. In local development, the convertApi router was mounted at `/api`
2. In Vercel deployment, the convertApi router was mounted at `/` (root)
3. Vercel's `vercel.json` rewrites `/api/*` requests to `/api/index`
4. This caused a mismatch where Vercel forwarded `/api/health` but the Express app was only looking for `/health`

## Solution
Modified `server.js` to consistently mount the convertApi router at `/api` for both environments:
- Removed the conditional logic that mounted the router at different paths
- Now the router is always mounted at `/api`
- This works because Vercel forwards the full path `/api/health` to the Express app

## Verification
Created and ran tests to verify the fix works in both environments:
- Local development: `http://localhost:3000/api/health` and `http://localhost:3000/api/info` work correctly
- Vercel deployment: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health` and `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/info` work correctly

## Expected API Endpoints
After the fix, the API endpoints are accessible at the same paths in both environments:
- `/api/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/api/info` - API information endpoint
- `/api/convert` - Image conversion endpoint

This resolves the Vercel deployment issue and ensures consistent API access across environments.
